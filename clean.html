        <p>
            My name is Erik Skår. <br> I'm a 16 year student who is currently in High School, and in my spare time I enjoy playing videogames and doing web design / programming. This year of HS I'm taking a course in <strong>IT</strong>, which so far is really fun and exciting. We are currently working with <strong>HTML and CSS</strong>. I've got some other programming experiences as well, including <strong>Python</strong>, in which I've made a couple of small and handy programs. I've got some basic knowledge of <strong>Javascript</strong>, which is barely enough to get me a couple of steps further in web development, but for the most part I just look up snippets on SO and tweak them until they fit my project. I've tried to teach myself some <strong>C#</strong>, but I just can't seem to get into it. One of my main obstacles is that I mainly program / develop on my laptop, which is currently running <strong>Linux Mint</strong>. As you might know, <strong>C#</strong> is based on the .NET framework, which isn't natively supported on Linux. In addition to this, I just haven't been able to get into the mindset of <strong>C#</strong>, and I find Python to be way easier to just pick up and make programs with. <br> When it comes to other hobbies I've had quite a few over the last couple of years. I've been on the National Team in diving, which is basically all there is for athletic hobbies. However I have quite a lot of experience with image and video editing / manipulation. I've been mainly been using <strong>Photoshop</strong> and <strong>Premiere Pro</strong>, but I do also have experience with <strong>After Effects</strong>, <strong>Vegas Pro</strong> and <strong>Gimp</strong>. <br> Apart from all of that I enjoy spending my time just fooling around technology, especially software, and just learning new things. For my next OS I will probably try <strong>Arch Linux</strong>, however I am concerned about the fact that most of the stuff that I'm currently used to won't work.
